Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy allowing full access to resources
2. Loadbalancer does not have HTTP->HTTPS redirection
3. The VPC default security group allow all inbound and outbound traffic which violates the AWS recommendation
4. EC2 instance TCP port 5000 is reachable from internet
5. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Set IAM policies for not allowing root user and to enforce MFA, as well as the specific permissions
2. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
3. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443
4. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance
5. Enable server-side encryption and logging for S3 bucket
