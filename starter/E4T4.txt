# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Add CloudFront in front of the load balancer and removes all external access to the instances by apply ssh rules to instances through AWS Systems Manager 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

VPC private endpoints alone would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, new files or objects will not get effected. You would need to encrypt all the files as well

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All changes that have been made to the original CloudFormation will be reset
